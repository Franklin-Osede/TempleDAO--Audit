### TempleDAO Protocol Security Review

Voluntary Security Research & Methodologies for TempleDAO

### About the TempleDAO Protocol

TempleDAO is a decentralized finance platform focused on token staking, liquidity provision, and yield optimization across multiple blockchains. Core functionalities include:

Staking: Users stake $TEMPLE tokens in vaults to earn protocol fees.

Liquidity Provision: Supply assets to TempleDAO pools to facilitate swaps and earn rewards.

Yield Strategies: Automated farming strategies that aggregate yields from underlying protocols.

Governance: On-chain voting and treasury management mechanisms.

### Repository Overview

This repository hosts scripts, configuration files, and documentation detailing the security research approach applied to the TempleDAO smart contracts. The focus is on proactively exploring attack vectors without asserting current vulnerabilities.

Research Scope & Objectives

The voluntary review aims to:

Map contract workflows: staking flows, reward distribution, and strategy execution.

Probe for reentrancy, unauthorized access, and race conditions.

Validate yield strategy logic under extreme market scenarios.

### Contracts under review:

StakingVault.sol

LiquidityPool.sol

StrategyManager.sol

Governance.sol

Treasury.sol

Techniques & Tools Used

A hybrid methodology combining automated and manual testing:

### Static Analysis

Slither: Solidity bug detection and code quality checks.

Mythril: Symbolic analysis for common exploit patterns.

Securify & SmartCheck: Cross-verification of static findings.

Dynamic & Fuzz Testing

Echidna: Property-based fuzzing for invariants like staking balances.

Manticore: Symbolic execution to traverse complex staking and withdrawal logic.

Foundry (forge): Custom solidity tests for edge-case scenarios.

### Formal Verification

Certora Prover: Formal proofs for critical invariants (e.g., reward calculations).

Manual Review & Penetration Techniques

Code walkthroughs targeting unchecked math, oracle dependencies, and upgradeability.

Transaction simulation via Hardhat to inspect revert reasons and event flows.

Scripting with Brownie/Web3.py for multi-user and time-manipulation tests.
